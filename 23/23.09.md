- **wsl development environment**  
The other day, I got to know `WSL`(window Subsystem for Linux). it enable to use Linux in Windows.  
I want to change Windows development environment into Linux one.  
I decorate `zsh` terminal using `oh-my-zsh`.  

    in the meantime, I learn  
    - **Linux directory**  
        / = root  
        / -> home/, usr/, bin/ ...  
        home/<user_name> = ~

    - **vim**  
        it is charity ware, helping uganda chilren (I read vim info)  
        put ctrl+z => go out vim for a moment, 'fg' to return   

    - **PATH**   
        path is default directory. when input&run command, terminal searching command in 'PATH' priorly.  
        ex) 'ls', 'cd' is in 'bin/', and 'bin/' is in `PATH`, we use 'cd' without accurate directory
